            <h2>Community Green Spaces</h2>
            <p>We believe that access to green spaces is a right that should be enjoyed by all. As part of our social 
                commitment, we collaborate with local communities to create and maintain public rooftop gardens and green 
                spaces. These areas become hubs for relaxation, community interaction, and environmental education.</p>

            <h2>Education Outreach</h2>
            <p>Empowering future generations with environmental awareness and knowledge is crucial. We organize educational 
                workshops and awareness campaigns in schools and communities, aiming to instill a sense of responsibility 
                towards nature, sustainable practices, and eco-conscious living.</p>

            <p>Through urban farming initiatives, we collaborate with underserved communities to establish rooftop gardens 
                that provide fresh produce and herbs. These gardens offer a source of nutritious food and supplement the diets 
                of families facing food insecurity.</p>
